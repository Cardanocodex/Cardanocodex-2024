# Smart Contract based Randomness for Clg Applications
  
## Description
Randomness for Clg Applications where users can input of college values and spin to determine the top 3 winners. The application leverages blockchain technology using the RNG library, which utilizes Smart Contracts to ensure the randomness and integrity of the results, making it perfect for college sports events and competitions.

## Problem Statement
The problem is ensuring fair and verifiable randomness in college events and competitions. Traditional methods of determining winners can be susceptible to bias, tampering, and lack of transparency. There is a need for a system that guarantees all participating teams have an equal and fair chance of winning, with results that are transparent and tamper-proof.

By using blockchain-based randomness, colleges can implement fair, auditable, and transparent processes that enhance trust among students, faculty, and administration.
Blockchain-based randomness can be incredibly useful in various college applications, particularly because of its transparency, verifiability, and resistance to tampering. Here are a few ways it could be applied:

## 1. Fair Student Selection Processes

	•	Exams or Project Groups: Randomly assign students to project groups or exam seating in a verifiable manner. Blockchain randomness ensures the process is transparent and can’t be manipulated by anyone.
	•	Scholarships or Grants: When multiple students have similar qualifications for limited scholarships, blockchain-based randomness can ensure fair, unbiased selection.

## 2. Lottery Systems

	•	Event Tickets or Participation: For events with limited seats (e.g., workshops, guest lectures, or hackathons), blockchain-based randomness could be used to fairly allocate tickets to interested students.
	•	Contests and Giveaways: Random prize giveaways for students or faculty, where fairness and transparency are crucial.

## 3. Fair Grading or Peer Review

	•	Peer Grading: Random allocation of students’ work to peers for review, ensuring anonymity and fairness. Blockchain randomness can help prove that the allocation process was random and unbiased.
	•	Project or Presentation Order: Randomly deciding the order of student presentations or viva voce exams in a fair way.

## 4. Resource Allocation

	•	Lab or Equipment Use: Fair allocation of limited resources like lab equipment or computer labs can be done through a blockchain-based randomness system, ensuring that everyone has an equal chance of access.
	•	Room Allocation for Hostels: Assigning rooms to students randomly for fairness and transparency.

## 5. Decision Making in Student Councils or Clubs

	•	Voting Ties: In cases where voting results in a tie in student bodies or clubs, blockchain-based randomness could be used to resolve the tie in a fair and transparent way.
	•	Activity Scheduling: Randomly deciding activity slots or scheduling presentations in college events in an unbiased manner.

## 6. Anonymous Feedback

	•	Anonymous Surveys or Feedback: Ensuring fair random sampling for anonymous surveys or feedback collection from students or faculty.
