### 1. **Your Project:**
   **College Election On-Chain Voting Portal**

### 2. **Your Project's Description:**
   A on-chain voting system built on the Cardano blockchain for securely conducting college elections. It ensures that votes are recorded transparently on-chain, allowing for verifiable results and reducing the risk of tampering. The front-end is built using Next.js, and MeshJS is used to integrate Cardano blockchain functionalities, while Firebase handles off-chain data storage.

### 3. **Problem You Are Trying to Solve:**
   Traditional voting systems in college elections are often susceptible to fraud, tampering, and lack of transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project aims to solve these issues by offering a decentralized voting platform where votes are securely recorded on-chain. The immutability and transparency of the blockchain ensure trust in the election process, allowing students to vote confidently knowing their votes will be accurately counted.

### 4. **Tech Stack Used:**
   - **Frontend:** Next.js
   - **Blockchain Integration:** MeshJS (Cardano Library)
   - **Backend/Storage:** Firebase for handling off-chain storage of candidate information and vote counts.
