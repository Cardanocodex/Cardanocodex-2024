**1. Your Project:**

- **Title:** ADA University - Blockchain Enrollment Process for ID Card and Bonafide Certificate

**2. Your Project's Description:**

- The project is a dApp that allows students to enroll in a demo university by connecting their wallet. After paying the enrollment fee, they can mint a digital ID card and a bonafide certificate, which are securely stored on the blockchain. This system simplifies the administrative process for both institutions and students, reducing paperwork and enabling the immutable verification of student credentials.

**3. What Problem You are Trying to Solve:**

- **Current Issues:**
  - Traditional student ID issuance and certification processes are cumbersome, involving paperwork, manual verification, and potential fraud.
  - Centralized storage of student data is vulnerable to hacking and loss.
  - Inefficient record-keeping for student information and certifications.
- **Solution:**
  - A blockchain-based solution provides a tamper-proof, transparent, and decentralized system for issuing student IDs and certifications. Students can access and verify their credentials at any time, while institutions benefit from streamlined operations and enhanced data security.

**4. Tech Stack Used While Building the Project:**

- **Frontend:** Svelte
- **Cardano Integration:** Meshjs
