# Project : Relink (Send Crypto to Anyone Even Without an Address)

## Project Description

Imagine if you, as a user, could send crypto to anyone using text, email, QR code, and/or a simple link. Relink aims to make crypto transfers as easy as sending a message. This increases user acquisition by simplifying the crypto transaction process, removing the need to know wallet addresses, and enabling seamless integration for non-crypto users.

## Problem We Are Trying to Solve

There are still onboarding issues with crypto, especially for users unfamiliar with blockchain technology. Sending crypto typically requires knowing the recipient’s wallet address, which can be a barrier for both users and businesses. Relink solves this by allowing users to send crypto without needing the recipient’s address. We created a website and a package, complete with documentation, to make this possible.
